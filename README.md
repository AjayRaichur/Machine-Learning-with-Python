## Installation notes
MLwP is built using Python 3.5.  The easiest way to set up a compatible
environment is to use [Conda](https://conda.io/).  This will set up a virtual
environment with the exact version of Python used for development along with all the
dependencies needed to run MLwP.

1.  [Download and install Conda](https://conda.io/docs/download.html).
2.  Create a Conda environment with Python 3. 

(**Note**: enter ```cd ~``` to go on **$HOME** , then perform these commands)

    ```
    conda create --name *your env name* python=3.5
    ```

3.  Now activate the Conda environment.

    ```
    source activate *your env name*
    ```

4.  Install the required dependencies.

    ```
    conda install --yes --file *path to requirements.txt*

## How good is the code ?
* It is well tested
* It passes style checks (PEP8 compliant)
* It can compile in its current state (and there are relatively no issues)

## How much support is available?
* FAQs (coming soon)
* Documentation (coming soon)

## Issues
Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests.
